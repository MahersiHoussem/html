        <b>Think of a document</b> that you would create in a word processor <i>like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. They usually consist of more than one style.</i> 

        They use different font sizes to indicate different section of the text,<small>like headers, body paragraphs</small> , footers, table of contents, captions, and so on.
        
        Unlike humans who can simply look at a document and understand the difference between a heading and a paragraph, computers donâ€™t have that intuition. In order to correctly render a web page, it must be explicitly told what each piece of content is.
        
        So how exactly do we instruct the browser to display web content? This is where Hypertext Markup Language(or HTML for short) can come in handy.
        
        HTML is the language in which most websites are written with. It is used to create web pages and ensure their functionality.
